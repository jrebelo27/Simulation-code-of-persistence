# Simulation-code-of-persistence

This is a repository for the R scripts underlying the paper "The power of dying slowly - persistence as unintentional dormancy".

The directory "scripts" contains the script used to run the simulations. Note that the parameter/variable notations in the script and in the tables differ from those in manuscript.
